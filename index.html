            <h2>Millionaire Billionaire Playboy</h2>
            <p> <b>Robert John Downey Jr.</b> (born April 4, 1965)[1] is an American actor. His career has been
                characterized by
                critical success in his youth, followed by a period of substance abuse and legal troubles, and a surge
                in popular and commercial success later in his career. In 2008, Downey was named by Time magazine among
                the 100 most influential people in the world, and from 2013 to 2015, he was listed by Forbes as
                Hollywood's highest-paid actor.</p>

            <h1>Career</h1>
            <h2>1983â€“1995: Early work and critical acclaim</h2>
            <p> <b>Downey</b> began building upon theater roles, including in the short-lived off-Broadway musical
                American
                Passion at the Joyce Theater in 1983, produced by Norman Lear. In 1985, he was part of the new, younger
                cast hired for Saturday Night Live, but following a year of poor ratings and criticism of the new cast's
                comedic talents, he and most of the new crew were dropped and replaced.[19] Rolling Stone magazine named
                Downey the worst SNL cast member in its entire run, stating that the "Downey Fail sums up everything
                that makes SNL great."[21] That same year, Downey had a dramatic acting breakthrough when he played
                James Spader's character's sidekick in Tuff Turf and then a bully in John Hughes's Weird Science.</p>
